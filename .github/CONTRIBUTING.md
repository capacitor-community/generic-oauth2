# Contributing

I'm happy to accept external contributions to the project in the form of feedback,
bug reports and even better - pull requests

## Issues

Issues are mostly used to track **bugs** and **feature requests** but you can also
ask questions as it's the only place I'm looking at.

Before reporting a bug or requesting a feature, run a few searches to
see if a similar issue has already been opened and ensure you’re not submitting
a duplicate.

### Bugs
* Choose the "Bug Report" template
* Fill in all relevant information, especially
* Describe steps to reproduce
* Full error message if any
* Your code if relevant

### Feature Requests
* Choose the "Feature Request" template
* Describe the feature. Be specific
* Explain why I should implement it.

## Pull Request Guidelines
* Please check to make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting to address the issue mentioned.
* Open a single PR for each subject.
* Develop in a topic branch, not main (feature-name).
* Write a convincing description of your PR and why I should land it.
* Update documentation comments where applicable.

### Only touch relevant files

* Make sure your PR stays focused on a single feature.
* Don't change project configs or any files unrelated to the subject you're working.
* Don't reformat code you don't modify.

### Fixing a bug?
* Mention it or create an issue if not exist
* Do not forgot to put [Fix # in your commit message to auto close](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)

### Keep your commit history short and clean.
* Keeping the history clean means making one commit per feature. (no fix of your fix)
* I will squash every PR.

### Make sure tests pass (if exist)
* Add relevant tests to cover the change.
* Make sure test-suite passes.
